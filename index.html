<p>Well Iam Madhu and my official name something spells wierd (according to me) Mathu Malar C, and Iam very lazy to change this name since I Have already started publishing papers and my passport contains the same</p>
<p>Well Iam basically Bioinformatician and Computational Biologist with Bioinformatics Degree, But during my undergrad course, and Masters I was specialised in structural Bioinformatics, especially understanding the secondary structure prediction of RNA folding  </p>



<p>Now Iam Pursuing my Phd in Bioinformatics and computational biology as well, in kolkata , in one of the esteemed research laboratory, Indian Institute Of Chemical Biology, Kolkata. My research includes developing various Bioinformatics pipelines, protocols for Genome assembly especially for long reads from pacbio sequencing technology. So far the sequencing assembly pipelines are developed for Illumina sequencing performed for various cynobacteria's collected from various parts of India as well.</p>
